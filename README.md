I've created a React.js-based Amazon clone. It mimics the main features of the Amazon website, enabling users to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases. The clone boasts a responsive design, leverages React Router for navigation, and employs state management for seamless user interactions. It offers a familiar shopping experience reminiscent of the real Amazon platform, all powered by React.js.
